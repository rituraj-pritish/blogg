    title: 'HOW TO SAVE 12 MONTHS OF LIVING EXPENSES TO FUND YOUR FREEDOM',

      'It’s All About Priorities\n\nI have a friend who is a well-paid manager at a Fortune 500 company. She has no kids and a husband who makes more money than her. Still, she complains about the same things every time we talk: not having enough money and not being able to quit her job.\n\nThis same friend also takes extravagant vacations every three months, goes out to eat two or three times a week and plans to buy a new car, though her old one is fine.\n\nMy point? Your financial well-being comes down to priorities.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Learn a Skill\n\nHaving a marketable skill greatly improves your chances of making more money. It’s what helps you shift from someone else determining your worth to you setting your own price.\n\nMy first skill was to teach myself how to build websites. Every night, from 12 – 4 AM, I studied web design after working two jobs. My middle name is Hustle.\n\nOn top of that, I went to grad school to learn about a new field called Instructional Design. Turns out it was a good move. While companies were firing training departments, they were hiring Instructional Designers left and right. By the time I moved to Chicago, I had so many design skills that I was turning down high paying contract offers.\n\nBut you don’t have to go to grad school to learn a skill. In fact, there are so many resources out there that I wouldn’t bother. Take free tutorials online, go to skill-related Meetups, take a class at your local community college or even check books out from the library to learn something that you can make money from.\n\n\nStep 2: Decide and Calculate\n\nDECIDE\nThe next thing you need to do is decide how much money you want to save in your freedom fund. Is it three months of expenses? Six months? Twelve? Decide what you’re comfortable with.\n\nNow, whatever number of months you come up with, add one extra because something will inadvertently come up causing you to spend a month of your hard earned savings.\n\nTip: Take into consideration your family structure. Are you young and single and comfortable with more risk? Do you have a family? Do you have a partner who will support you? Do you have a partner who won’t support you? All of these questions affect the decision.\n\nCALCULATE\nNow it’s time to set the numbers. You can do this.\n\nPull up your bank accounts online and identify your regular monthly expenses.\nTake a pen and pad and make a list of all of your monthly expenses.\nAdd up the amounts. This is the maximum amount you need each month.\nDouble-check your accounts (credit cards too!) to make sure you haven’t missed anything.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Downsize\n\nThink you’re ready to start saving now? Not so fast. Remember what I said about priorities and sacrifice earlier? This step is where those come to play. When you tell people to cut back on spending, you quickly separate the walkers from the talkers.\n\nNotice how I said “the maximum amount” in the Calculate section above? That’s because you haven’t downsized yet. Now that you have a moneymaking skill and you know how much you spend, it’s time to cut back on expenses. Follow these steps:\n\nReview your expenses and identify any items that you can eliminate or reduce.\nChange your spending habits to get rid of what you don’t need.\nMake a new list of your expenses.\nTotal the amount (this will be the amount that you’re going to save each month).\nSaving will be much harder if you skip this step. Downsizing will free up cash that you can snowball into savings. These are the sacrifices I made to add cash to my pocket:\n\nGave my car away before moving to Chicago (Money saved – approx. $4000/yr)\nDownsized from a 2-bedroom to a 1-bedroom apartment (Money saved – approx. $2400/yr)\nMoved out of a trendy neighborhood where I was shopping and eating out too much to a quieter, more residential one (Money saved – approx. $2500/ yr)',

      'pro-cras-ti-na-tion |prəˌkrastəˈnāSHən, prō-|\nnoun\nthe action of delaying or postponing something: your first tip is to avoid procrastination.\n\nWho would have thought that after decades of struggle with procrastination, the dictionary, of all places, would hold the solution.\n\nAvoid procrastination. So elegant in its simplicity.\n\nWhile we’re here, let’s make sure obese people avoid overeating, depressed people avoid apathy, and someone please tell beached whales that they should avoid being out of the ocean.\n\nNo, “avoid procrastination” is only good advice for fake procrastinators—those people that are like, “I totally go on Facebook a few times every day at work—I’m such a procrastinator!” The same people that will say to a real procrastinator something like, “Just don’t procrastinate and you’ll be fine.”\n\nThe thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn’t optional—it’s something they don’t know how to not do.\n\nIn college, the sudden unbridled personal freedom was a disaster for me—I did nothing, ever, for any reason. The one exception was that I had to hand in papers from time to time. I would do those the night before, until I realized I could just do them through the night, and I did that until I realized I could actually start them in the early morning on the day they were due. This behavior reached caricature levels when I was unable to start writing my 90-page senior thesis until 72 hours before it was due, an experience that ended with me in the campus doctor’s office learning that lack of blood sugar was the reason my hands had gone numb and curled up against my will. (I did get the thesis in—no, it was not good.)\n\nEven this post took much longer than it should have, because I spent a bunch of hours doing things like seeing this picture sitting on my desktop from a previous post, opening it, looking at it for a long time thinking about how easily he could beat me in a fight, then wondering if he could beat a tiger in a fight, then wondering who would win between a lion and a tiger, and then googling that and reading about it for a while (the tiger would win). I have problems.',

      'The secrets to love, life and happiness can be unlocked with three simple words: Play. The. Sims.\n\nLeft to their own devices, your Sim will do whatever they feel like, which is usually strikingly stupid. (In real life, that may sound familiar). You interrupt your Sim’s autopilot by giving them sage instructions, like “read a book” or “stare at that girl’s butt”.\n\nBeing successful at The Sims is very easy. It’s just like real life, except without a barrier between what you decide and what you do.\n\nSay you want to get fit.\n\nIn the Sims, you immediately buy whatever lame fitness equipment you can afford. If you can’t afford anything, go run in the park. Each day you tell your Sim to spend a spare minute exercising, and although progress is slow, you see their bars slowly inch up. Success is guaranteed.\n\nIn real life you think about getting fit. You’re not sure what to buy. Can you really afford the ‘right’ equipment? You read reviews. Do you have enough time? You ask questions on Quora. Maybe you buy something. You don’t know how to use it. Maybe you use it a couple times. You don’t see any results. You talk and think and share and do anything but exercise.\n\nIF ONLY SOMEONE WOULD TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.\n\nThe first lesson from The Sims is good decisions require little thought. To get fit: exercise. To be smarter: read. To eat healthier: cook. Such mechanics are elementary to a child playing the game, but when leading your own life, your mischievous mind paralyses you with too much thinking. Stop holding out for perfect decisions. Pick. Act.\n\nYou can solve half the hassles of humanity this way. “I like this girl, how do I get her to like me?” Just click on her, and pick something.\n\n“But what do I say?” Anything moves you closer to your goal. Pick something. “But she might not like me!” Right now, she doesn’t even know you. Fix that. Pick something. “But what would we name our future kids?” SHUT UP AND PICK SOMETHING.\n\nThinking isn’t inherently bad of course, but save the deep stuff for writing your novel and designing a nuclear powered washing machine. If you’re not clicking your mouse much, you’re probably not playing the game very well.',

      "I'm amazed at what can be done in one focused day.\n\nAnd we all get 24 hours each day.\n\nIt can hard to spend all that time on meaningful things, but I think if you gradually quit things you don't want to spend time on, you gradually spend time on more important things. If you systematically eliminate things that are a waste of time, pretty soon you're doing things with at least some value.\n\nTracking time helps a lot with this. Just jotting down on paper once an hour what you did the last hour or so. Often, when it seems like forever has passed when I'm trying to work out something frustrating, it's only been 5 or 7 minutes. On the other side, a lot of high-stimulation websites, it'll seem like 5 minutes have passed, but it's been three hours.\n\nTry tracking your time sometimes. It's huge. I realized I was spending way too much time following sports, so I quit spectator sports. Haven't been back. Don't miss it.\n\nInstead I read a little more, walk around a little more, connect with people a little more, work a little more, cook a little more - I just spent a little more time on all the things that matter. I figure if you gradually quit bad things, eventually you're spending your time reasonably well. And if you gradually introduce good things and focus on those, then you start doing more and more amazing things.\n\n24 hours is a lot of time. A lot can be done in 24 hours, if you're mindful of where the time is going.",

      'The reason for our suffering is our resistance to the changes in life.\n\nAnd life is all changes.\n\nWhile I resist change (and suffer) just like anyone else, I have learned to adapt. I’ve learned some flexibility. I’ve realized this:\n\nEverything changes, and this is beautiful.\n\nThe Pain of Life’s Changes\nWhat do I mean that our suffering comes from resistance to the changes in life?\n\nLet’s take a look at some things that give us trouble:\n\nSomeone yells at you at work. The change is rooted in the fact that we expect people to treat us kindly and fairly and with respect, but the reality is that they don’t always. When they don’t, we resist this reality, and want things to be the way we want them to be. And so we get mad, or hurt, or offended.\nYour 3-year-old (or 13-year-old) won’t listen to you. Again, you expect your child to behave a certain way, but of course reality is different. And when reality doesn’t conform to our expectations, we are stressed out.\nYou lose your job. This is a huge change, that affects not only your financial stability, but your identity. If you are a teacher, and lose your teaching job, you now have to deal with the changes in how you see yourself. This can be very difficult. Resisting these changes (and the financial constraints that come with the job loss) can be very painful.\nYou have too many tasks and feel overwhelmed. What is the change here? We want things to be in control, but of course they aren’t. New tasks and information come in, new requests, new demands. And these are changes that are difficult, because we thought we had our day under control, and now it’s not. And so we feel overwhelmed and stressed.\nA loved one dies. One of the ultimate changes is death, of course, but what has changed? Well, the person is obviously no longer in our life (at least, not in the same way), but just as painfully, we are not the same person when a loved one dies. We have to change who we are — we’re now a widower instead of a husband, a father without his daughter, or a friend who is left alone (for example). We want life to be the way it was, but it isn’t, so we grief, we rage.\nThat’s just a start. Things change all the time, and we resist it. Our day changes, our relationships change, other people don’t act the way they should, we ourselves are changing, constantly, and this is hard to deal with.\n\nSo this is the pain of change, of not being in control, of things not meeting our expectations.\n\nHow do we cope?\n\nThe Beauty of Life Changes\nWe can cope with the pain in numerous ways: get angry and yell, drink or do drugs, eat junk food, watch TV or find other distractions. We can find positive ways to cope with the stress and hurt and anger: exercise, talking about our problems with a friend, or trying to take control of the situation in some way (planning, taking action, having a difficult conversation to work out differences, etc.).\n\nOr, we can embrace the changes.\n\nIf changes are a basic fact of life (actually life is nothing but change), then why resist? Why not embrace and enjoy?\n\nSee the beauty of change.\n\nIt’s hard, because we’re so used to resisting.\n\nLet’s put aside our resistance and judgments for a few minutes, and look for beauty in life’s changes:\n\nSomeone yells at you at work. This person is hurting, frustrated, angry, and is taking it out on you. They are reaching out, trying to control the chaos of life (uselessly of course), and are not succeeding. Can you empathize with this? Have you ever felt this? There is beauty in our similarities, in our joint pain, in our connection as humans. Mentally embrace this beautiful, hurting human being, feel his pain, give your compassion.\nYour 3-year-old (or 13-year-old) won’t listen to you. Amazingly, your child is asserting her independence. She is showing that she’s a full human being, not just a robot who follows orders. Have you ever been in that position? Have you ever been frustrated by someone else trying to control you? There is beauty in this independence, this fighting spirit, this rebellion. That’s what life is (OK, life is change, but also rebellion against control). Smile at this beauty, love it, give your child some space to grow.\nYou lose your job. As difficult as this is, it’s an ending, but also a beginning. It’s the start of a new journey, the opportunity to refresh your life, to reinvent who you are. See the beauty in this opportunity, the liberation from the “usual way”.\nYou have too many tasks and feel overwhelmed. This is difficult, without a doubt, but it’s possible to surrender to the chaos of tasks and information and demands. You can’t do them all at once, but you can let go of wanting things to be under your complete control. There is beauty in this chaos. It is random, it is crazy, it is life. See the pain of your resistance, and the beauty in this struggle as well. Then realize you can only do one thing at a time, and do that. Then let that go, and do the next thing. By embracing the chaos and seeing the beauty in it, we can be less overwhelmed and stressed out.\nA loved one dies. Maybe the hardest one of all — it’s indubitably sad. But death is an ending, which is a necessity. Endings are necessary for beauty: otherwise we don’t appreciate the thing, because it’s unlimited. Limits are beauty. And death is the ultimate limit, a reminder that we need to appreciate this beautiful thing called life while we have it. Death is also a beginning — not in the sense of an afterlife, but a beginning for the survivors. While we have lost an important person, this ending, like the loss of a job, is a moment of reinvention. It might seem sad, but we are forced to reinvent our lives when a loved one dies, and in this reinvention is opportunity. Which I think is beautiful. Finally, of course, death is an opportunity to remember the person’s life, and be grateful for what they gave us.\nThe possibilities of finding beauty in our struggles with change are endless. And, I believe, that’s beautiful in its own way.',
